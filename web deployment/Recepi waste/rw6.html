	<img src="rw6.jpg">
	<p>The Nut shells are a good addition to your compost heap because they don’t break down as quickly as other items. Nut shells also work well as a mulch, the reason is same– they don’t break down easliy. In compost, they can help vary the thickness of it, this later helps in soil aeration. A warning: don’t use black walnut nut hulls beacuse they have a large concentrations of juglone which is toxic to many plants.</p>

	<h3>Paper Towel Rolls</h3>

	<p>
		Instead of throwing out the paper towel roll, use it in the garden. Cut it into peices and press it into the soil around your newly planted seedlings to give them a extra protection from slugs and other ground dwelling pests. You can also use paper towel rolls as seed starters (*you can also use toilet paper rolls).

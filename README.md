# Kitchen Recipe and Kitchen Garden


As we are aware, in metropolitan cities, people generally live in small houses or flats where they don’t have proper space to cultivate or to grow plants. Although many people want to grow different types of plants in their homes due to lack of space, they couldn’t. On the other hand, we can find many people who manage to grow plants in their small spaced home but then they destroyed it due to a lack of knowledge about good compost, pesticide, etc.
This is the major problem with the people who search here & there, got confused and do whatever they think leads to damage to their plants.

Besides this, our app also provides a vast range of food recipes along with the kitchen gardening methods which they can do with their recipe’s waste.

What are the different requirements to create this app? 

We can find many smartphones where storage space is only limited and people can’t download applications with the larger sizes. So, to eliminate this problem, we have tried to create a mobile application with minimal storage space. For this, we have created an application frontend on Android and the backend will run on runtime on the website.  
Software and languages used for creating this application:

∙       Android Studio with kotlin

∙       Sublime text 3 with HTML and CSS
